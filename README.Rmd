The Bundestag distributes [biographical and election data](https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata/) on all its members since 1949. This data, however, can be difficult to work with because XML files store information in an arbitrary number of dimensions. btmembers downloads the file "Stammdaten aller Abgeordneten seit 1949 im XML-Format" from the Bundestag website and converts it either to (a) four data frames nested into a list (retaining all the information of the original XML file) or (b) a single, condensed data frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jolyphil/btmembers")
```
## Usage

### Importing a list with all the information from the Bundestag

btmembers exports a single function: `import_members()`. By default, this function returns a list containing four data frames (`namen`, `bio`, `wp`, and `inst`), which together preserve all the information contained in the XML file provided by the Bundestag. 

```{r import-list}
library(btmembers)
members <- import_members()
summary(members)
```

The data frame `namen` contains data on names of members of the Bundestag. Each row represents a name. Members can have multiple names (N~names~ > N~members~). 

```{r namen}
summary(members$namen)
```

The data frame `bio` contains biographical information on members. Each row represents a biographical entry. There is one entry by member (N~bio~ = N~members~). 

```{r bio}
members$bio
```

The data frame `wp` contains data on the parliamentary terms served by the members. Each row represents a member-term. Members might have served multiple terms (N~terms~ > N~members~).

```{r wp}
members$wp
```

The data frame `inst` contains records on functions occupied by members inside institutions of the Bundestag. Each row represents an member-term-function. Members might have had multiple functions during multiple terms (N~functions~ > N~terms~ > N~members~).

```{r inst}
members$inst
```


### Importing a condensed data frame

Instead of importing a list with all the information from Bundestag, `import_members()` can also load a condensed data frame. Each row corresponds to a member-term. Most of the information contained in the original data is preserved except only the most recent name of the member is retained and institutions are removed. A new column named `fraktion` is added to the data. `fraktion` is a recoded variable and refers to the faction the member spent most time in during a given parliamentary term.

```{r import-df}
members_df <- import_members(condensed_df = TRUE)
members_df[c("nachname", "vorname", "wp", "fraktion")]
```


### Joining data frames

You can join data frames by `id` (the members' identification numbers) and/or `wp` (the parliamentary terms). 

```{r join}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

members$namen %>%
  slice_max(historie_von) %>% # keep most recent name
  left_join(members$bio, by = "id") %>%
  left_join(members$wp, by = "id") %>%
  left_join(members$inst, by = c("id", "wp")) %>%
  select(nachname, vorname, wp, ins_lang, mdbins_von, mdbins_bis, fkt_lang, fktins_von, fktins_bis)
```


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
